    "A daemon is required because of the unpredictability of the order in which the update functions of each of the unity objects are called. Because the \"send newoutput\" leads to a \"read operation\" on Python's part, it can get blocked. But it is okay if a daemon gets blocked since all the other daemons can still read, ensuring that all the daemons finally receive the data (no matter what the order). Hence, the Python script can then read the daemons in order."

One pair for communication between C# script and the Python daemon, and another pair of pipes for communication between Python script and Python Daemon. pipes can simply be initiated by running the `\"mkfifo pipe_name\"` command, but the real problem lies in opening the pipes, and handshaking for establishing communication. Hence, the following method is used to establish communication :"

To address this problem, we use a modified process for handshaking between the Unity object and the communication daemon :\n",
